##📝 About This Project

This repository contains a single static HTML file, which is intentional.

The project does not require a backend, frameworks, or complex file structure.
Its goal is to stay:

⚡ Fast
🔒 Private
📱 Mobile-friendly
🧘 Easy to update
☁️ Deployable anywhere (Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

This repository mainly serves as a convenient deployment source for hosting on Vercel.

##📂 Why Only One File?

The application is fully self-contained in one HTML file because:

• It avoids unnecessary complexity
• No external dependencies are required
• It loads instantly
• It is easier to maintain for personal use
• It works perfectly for a simple checklist interface

This repository isn’t meant to showcase large-scale code — it’s purely a utility tool.
